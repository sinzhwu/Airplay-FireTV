# PhairPlay

PhairPlay is a free, open-source, ad-free AirPlay 2 receiver for Android TV and Fire TV. It lets your macOS or iOS/iPadOS device mirror its screen and audio directly to your TV — no Apple TV required.

## Installation

### Option A: Build from Source

1. **Install prerequisites**
   ```bash
   # Install Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio
   # Install JDK 17 or later
   ```

   ```
   The APK will be in `app/build/outputs/apk/`.

4. **Install via ADB**
   ```bash
   # Enable ADB on your TV first (see below)
   adb connect <TV-IP-ADDRESS>

   # Google TV:
   adb install app/build/outputs/apk/googletv/debug/app-googletv-debug.apk

   # Fire TV:

## How to Use

1. Launch PhairPlay on your TV. You will see the Waiting Screen with your TV's name.
2. On your Mac, click the **AirPlay** icon in the menu bar (or go to **System Preferences → Displays → AirPlay Display**).
3. Select your TV from the list (it should appear as your TV's name).

## Known Limitations

- **FairPlay-protected content** (Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+, etc.) cannot be mirrored — this is an Apple DRM restriction, not a PhairPlay limitation.
- **Audio-only AirPlay** (streaming from Apple Music app) is not fully supported in v1.0.
- If your router has **AP isolation** or **multicast filtering** enabled, PhairPlay may not appear in the AirPlay menu. Disable these settings on your router.
- On very busy 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi networks, you may experience latency above 100ms. Use 5 GHz or Ethernet for best results.
