### 1.5 Service Control

- FR-24: The user MUST be able to **start**, **stop**, and **restart** all receiver services from the app UI.
- FR-25: The receiver runs as an Android **ForegroundService** so it continues operating when the app is in the background (e.g., screensaver active).
- FR-26: A **persistent notification** MUST be shown while the ForegroundService is running, with quick-action buttons: Stop, Restart.
- FR-27: Service state (running/stopped/error) MUST be visible on the HomeScreen at all times.
- FR-28: Stopping the service MUST release all network ports, close all connections, and stop advertising.
- FR-29: Restarting the service MUST perform a clean stop followed by a clean start within 3 seconds.

### 1.6 Settings

- FR-30: A dedicated **Settings screen** MUST be accessible from the HomeScreen.
- FR-31: Settings MUST be persisted between app restarts (Android DataStore / SharedPreferences).
- FR-32: The following settings MUST be configurable:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Display name | Android device name | Name shown in sender pickers |
| AirPlay enabled | ON | Enable/disable AirPlay service |
| Miracast enabled | ON | Enable/disable Miracast service |
| Cast enabled | ON | Enable/disable Cast service |
| AirPlay PIN auth | OFF | Require PIN for AirPlay connections |
| Start on boot | OFF | Auto-start service on device boot |
| Show debug overlay | OFF | Show FPS / latency overlay (dev) |

### 1.7 Video / Audio

- FR-33: Decode video using hardware `MediaCodec`. Supported codecs per protocol:
  - **AirPlay**: H.264 AVC (mandatory, up to High Profile Level 5.2); H.265 HEVC (optional, hardware check required).
  - **Miracast**: H.264 AVC CHP/CBP (mandatory); H.265 HEVC (optional).
  - **Google Cast**: H.264 AVC + VP8 (mandatory); H.265 HEVC, VP9, AV1 (optional, API-level gated).
  - Software fallback is NOT used; if hardware decoder is unavailable, the stream is rejected gracefully.
- FR-34: Display decoded video full-screen maintaining aspect ratio.
- FR-35: Play audio in sync with video (A/V drift ≤ 40ms).
- FR-36: For **audio-only** streams (no video): play through the default audio output without launching the streaming screen.
- FR-37: Return to HomeScreen (or remain on HomeScreen for audio-only) when stream ends.
- FR-43: For **image / photo** transfers (AirPlay `/photo` endpoint): display received JPEG or PNG full-screen. No video decoder is involved; image is decoded via Android's `BitmapFactory`. Return to HomeScreen when sender disconnects.

### 1.8 Internationalization (i18n)

### FairPlay DRM – Evaluation Note

**What is FairPlay?** Apple FairPlay Streaming (FPS) is Apple's DRM system for protecting HLS content. It is used by Apple TV+, iTunes, and other Apple-licensed content platforms.

**Technical path to implementation:**
1. Register as an Apple Developer (active program membership required).
2. Apply to Apple for an **FPS deployment package** (Key Security Module — KSM). Apple approves or denies based on use case.
3. Implement the FPS key exchange protocol: the receiver must communicate with a license server using Apple's proprietary key exchange, using the provided KSM library (binary-only, Apple-supplied).
4. The KSM binary is platform-specific — Apple provides it for macOS/iOS/tvOS. An Android implementation would require Apple to supply an Android-compatible KSM, which Apple has never done publicly.

**Conclusion for PhairPlay v1:**
- FairPlay is **not implementable** on Android without Apple providing an Android KSM binary — which they have not done.
- Even if Apple provided one, the license terms would likely be **incompatible with open-source distribution** under Apache 2.0.
- **FairPlay is excluded from PhairPlay v1 and is not on the roadmap** unless Apple changes their licensing policy.
- PhairPlay can receive unencrypted AirPlay streams and AirPlay streams encrypted with the open AES-128-CTR session key mechanism. FairPlay-protected premium content (e.g., Apple TV+) will not play.

> **Note on open codecs:** H.265 HEVC, VP9, and AV1 are fully implementable on Android via `MediaCodec` with hardware support checks. These are planned as optional features in v2 behind `MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities` capability queries at runtime.

> **Note on HDCP and Widevine/PlayReady:** HDCP (for Miracast) is negotiated at the WFD protocol level and enforced by hardware — no software implementation is needed. Widevine and PlayReady (for Cast) are handled by the Google Cast SDK and the Android DRM framework (`MediaDrm`) — the app does not need to implement DRM logic directly.
