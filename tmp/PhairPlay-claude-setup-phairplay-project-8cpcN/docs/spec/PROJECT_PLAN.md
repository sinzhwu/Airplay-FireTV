**Tasks:**
- [ ] `MdnsService.kt` — AirPlay mDNS advertisement (complete implementation)
- [ ] `WifiDirectManager.kt` — Wi-Fi P2P manager for Miracast discovery
- [ ] `CastAdvertiser.kt` — Cast receiver advertisement stub

- [ ] Settings: device name applied to all advertisers

**Definition of Done:**
- macOS sees PhairPlay within 3s (AC-2.1)
- Device name from Settings is shown in picker
- WifiP2p service registered (Miracast P2P)
- Service cards update when advertising starts/stops

---

## Phase 3 – AirPlay Handshake (RTSP) + Photo Endpoint

**Milestone:** M3

**Goal:** Full AirPlay RTSP session establishment end-to-end, plus HTTP photo endpoint.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] `RtspHandler.kt` — full RTSP implementation (all methods, SDP parsing)
- [ ] SDP parser — extract H.264/H.265 params, audio codec params, AAC keys, port numbers
- [ ] `PhotoHandler.kt` — HTTP PUT/DELETE `/photo` endpoint; JPEG/PNG decode via BitmapFactory
- [ ] `PhotoScreen.kt` — full-screen Fragment with ImageView and image downsampling
- [ ] AirPlay `features` bitmask: set Photo bit (bit 1) in mDNS TXT record
- [ ] Input validation — all fields, max sizes, format checks
- [ ] Unit tests: all RTSP methods, SDP edge cases, malformed input, photo decode

**Definition of Done:** AC-3.x — full handshake from macOS without RTSP errors; photo sent from iOS Photos app appears on screen.

---

## Phase 4 – AirPlay Video (H.264 mandatory, H.265 optional)

**Milestone:** M4

**Tasks:**

**Mandatory (H.264):**
- [ ] `VideoDecoder.kt` — full MediaCodec H.264 implementation (all profiles up to High Profile Level 5.2)
- [ ] RTP video packet demuxing from RTSP TCP stream (interleaved `$` framing)
- [ ] SPS/PPS extraction and correct `MediaFormat` configuration
- [ ] `StreamingScreen.kt` — full SurfaceView integration
- [ ] Aspect ratio / letterbox for all common aspect ratios (16:9, 4:3, 21:9)

**Optional (H.265 / HEVC):**
- [ ] Runtime HEVC capability check via `MediaCodecList.findDecoderForFormat("video/hevc")`
- [ ] `VideoDecoder.kt` extended: supports both `video/avc` and `video/hevc` MIME types
- [ ] SDP negotiation: detect `H265/90000` in `a=rtpmap`; fall back to H.264 if HEVC unavailable
- [ ] Advertise HEVC support in AirPlay `features` bitmask only if hardware supports it

**Definition of Done:** AC-4.x — ≥25fps, ≤100ms latency on Google TV for H.264 streams. HEVC streams play if hardware is capable.

---

## Phase 5 – AirPlay Audio (full codec matrix)

**Milestone:** M5

**Tasks:**

**Mandatory audio codecs:**
- [ ] `AudioPlayer.kt` — AES-128-CTR decrypt + AudioTrack
- [ ] AAC-LC decode via MediaCodec `audio/mp4a-latm`
- [ ] AAC-ELD decode via MediaCodec `audio/mp4a-latm` (ELD variant)
- [ ] ALAC decode via MediaCodec `audio/alac` (for music/podcast streaming)
- [ ] LPCM pass-through via AudioTrack directly (no MediaCodec needed)
- [ ] RTP audio UDP socket
- [ ] NTP timing sync (TimingHandler)
- [ ] Audio-only mode: bypass VideoDecoder; stay on HomeScreen

**Optional surround audio:**
- [ ] Runtime surround capability check: `AudioManager.getDevices()` → check `AudioFormat.ENCODING_AC3` / `ENCODING_E_AC3_JOC` support
- [ ] AC-3 (Dolby Digital) output via AudioTrack with `ENCODING_AC3` if device supports it
- [ ] E-AC-3 / Dolby Atmos (JOC) output via AudioTrack with `ENCODING_E_AC3_JOC` if device supports it
- [ ] Advertise surround capability in AirPlay `features` bitmask only if hardware supports it

**Definition of Done:** AC-5.x — A/V sync ≤40ms. ALAC music streams play correctly. Surround audio passes through on capable hardware.

## Phase 6 – Miracast Receiver (full codec matrix)

**Milestone:** M6

**Goal:** Miracast screen mirroring from Windows 10+ and Android with full WFD codec matrix.

**Tasks:**

**Protocol and transport:**

- [ ] `MiracastSession.kt` — WFD RTSP negotiation (capability exchange, `wfd-video-formats`, `wfd-audio-codecs`)
- [ ] WFD capability advertisement: report supported video/audio codecs in WFD capability exchange
- [ ] MPEG-TS demuxer: parse incoming MPEG Transport Stream; extract video/audio elementary streams

**Mandatory video (H.264):**
- [ ] `MiracastDecoder.kt` — H.264 AVC decode via VideoDecoder (Constrained High Profile + Constrained Baseline Profile)
- [ ] H.264 level negotiation: advertise up to Level 4.2 in WFD capability exchange

- [ ] Runtime HEVC capability check; advertise in WFD `wfd-video-formats` only if available
- [ ] H.265 HEVC decode via extended VideoDecoder

**Mandatory audio (LPCM):**
- [ ] `MiracastAudio.kt` — LPCM 16-bit / 48 kHz decode via AudioTrack direct pass-through

**Optional audio (AAC, AC-3):**
- [ ] AAC-LC / AAC-HE decode via MediaCodec; advertise in WFD `wfd-audio-codecs`
- [ ] AC-3 (Dolby Digital) pass-through via AudioTrack `ENCODING_AC3` (if device supports)
- [ ] Runtime audio capability check before advertising surround in WFD exchange

**DRM / copy protection:**
- [ ] Negotiate HDCP 2.x in WFD capability exchange (`wfd-content-protection`)
- [ ] Graceful fallback if HDCP negotiation fails: reject session with WFD RTSP 403

**UI:**
- [ ] Miracast status card updates in HomeScreen (connecting, streaming, codec info in debug overlay)

**Definition of Done:** AC-6.x — Windows 10 screen mirroring works end-to-end; LPCM and AAC audio work; H.265 works on capable hardware; HDCP negotiated.

## Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| AirPlay undocumented behavior | High | High | Reference UxPlay/RPiPlay open-source implementations for protocol understanding; write code from scratch |
| Miracast requires hidden Android APIs on some devices | High | High | Use WifiP2pManager + custom WFD RTSP; test early on real hardware |
| Cast not available on Fire TV (no GMS) | Certain | Medium | Graceful fallback; disable Cast toggle on Fire TV flavor |
| Wi-Fi P2P conflicts with existing AP connection | Medium | High | Test multi-connected scenarios early |
| Google Cast SDK license terms | Low | High | Review carefully before distribution |
| Open-source AirPlay implementations: legal risk | Low | High | Reference only for protocol understanding; write code from scratch |
| H.265 / HEVC not available on all target devices | High | Low | Runtime capability check; feature advertised only when HW available; graceful fallback to H.264 |
| AV1 hardware decoder not available below API 31 | High | Low | Software AV1 decoder (API 29+) as fallback; advertise only if decoder found via MediaCodecList |
| HDCP negotiation fails on some Android TV hardware | Medium | Medium | Graceful WFD session rejection; log HDCP capability at startup; test on Fire TV (limited HDCP HW) |
| Dolby Atmos / AC-3 pass-through requires specific HDMI setup | Medium | Low | Runtime check via AudioManager; optional feature; disabled if not advertised by sink device |
| FairPlay DRM requested by users | Low | Low | Document clearly in FAQ: FairPlay not supported by design; AirPlay screen mirroring (non-DRM) works |
| Large JPEG/PNG images (e.g. 12MP from iPhone) cause OOM | Medium | Medium | Use BitmapFactory.Options.inSampleSize; downsample to display resolution before decoding |
| MPEG-TS demuxing complexity for WFD | Medium | High | Consider reusing ExoPlayer's TS extractor for WFD streams to avoid reimplementing demuxing |
