 * MainActivityTest — Instrumented tests for MainActivity.

 * WHY: Unit tests can mock Android APIs, but some things must be tested on
 * a real Android device (or emulator) to verify they actually work:
 * - Does the Activity start without crashing?
 * - Is the WaitingScreen visible on startup?
 * - Does the UI respond correctly to orientation changes?
 *
 * HOW: These are instrumented tests — they run on a real Android device or
 * emulator (not on the development machine). Run with:
 *   ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
 *
 * The [ActivityScenarioRule] automatically starts and stops the Activity
 * for each test.
