/**
 * WaitingScreen — The idle screen shown when no AirPlay sender is connected.
 *
 * WHY: Users need visual confirmation that PhairPlay is running and ready to receive.
 * Without this screen, the TV would show a black screen and users wouldn't know
 * if the app is working or not.
 *
 * HOW: A simple full-screen view showing:
 * - The app name ("PhairPlay")
 * - The device's AirPlay name (what appears in macOS AirPlay picker)
 * - Brief instructions for the user
 *
 * Created programmatically in MainActivity.createScreens() and added to
 * the waiting_container FrameLayout.
 *
 * Example:
 *   val waitingScreen = WaitingScreen(context)
 *   container.addView(waitingScreen)
 *   // The screen reads the device name automatically from Android settings

     * to select on their Mac.

     * The name is read at startup and doesn't change while the app is running.
