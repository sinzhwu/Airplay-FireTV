/**
 * PhairPlayApp — The Application class for PhairPlay.
 *
 * WHY: Android requires an Application subclass to run initialization code before
 * any Activity or Service starts. We use this to set up logging (Timber) once
 * at startup.
 *
 * HOW: This class is referenced in AndroidManifest.xml via android:name=".PhairPlayApp".
 * It is instantiated automatically by the Android framework when the app process starts.
 *
 * Example (automatic — no user code needed):
 *   The app starts → Android creates PhairPlayApp → onCreate() runs → Timber is ready.

     * Sets up Timber logging.
     *
     * In debug builds: logs to Android logcat with full file/line info.
     * In release builds: only logs warnings and errors (no verbose/debug output).
     *
     * WHY: Timber is a tiny wrapper around android.util.Log that adds:
     * - Automatic class name as a log tag (no more TAG constants everywhere)
     * - Easy filtering by log level in release builds
     * - The ability to swap the log backend (useful for crash reporting in future)
