/**
 * StreamingScreen — Full-screen view that displays the AirPlay video stream.
 *
 * WHY: The decoded video from MediaCodec must be rendered to a [Surface].
 * A [SurfaceView] provides a dedicated, hardware-accelerated drawing surface
 * that can receive MediaCodec output directly — no intermediate bitmap copies.
 * This is the lowest-latency way to display video on Android.
 *
 * HOW: Add this view to the streaming_container in activity_main.xml.
 * Call [getSurface] to get the Surface to pass to [VideoDecoder.initialize].
 * The Surface is valid as long as this view is attached to the window.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The Surface becomes available asynchronously after the view is
 * laid out. [getSurface] returns null if called before the Surface is ready.
 * [VideoDecoder.initialize] must not be called until [getSurface] returns non-null.
 *
 * Example:
 *   val streamingScreen = StreamingScreen(context)
 *   container.addView(streamingScreen)
 *   // Later, when surface is ready:
 *   val surface = streamingScreen.getSurface()
 *   videoDecoder.initialize(spsBytes, ppsBytes, width, height)
