/**
 * BootReceiver — starts [PhairPlayService] on device boot if "Start on boot" is enabled.
 *
 * WHY: Android kills all services on reboot. For a receiver app to work without
 * the user manually reopening the app, we register for BOOT_COMPLETED.
 * The setting is checked asynchronously before starting the service to avoid
 * unnecessary foreground service starts that would show an unexpected notification.
 *
 * HOW:
 * 1. System fires BOOT_COMPLETED ~30–60 seconds after boot.
 * 2. We read [AppSettings.startOnBoot] from DataStore.
 * 3. If enabled, call [ServiceController.start] — that fires a foreground service
 *    intent which is safe to call from a BroadcastReceiver.
 *
 * Declared in AndroidManifest.xml with `exported="false"` — only the system
 * can fire BOOT_COMPLETED, so no external app can trigger this receiver.
 *
 * NOTE: On Android 10+ a BroadcastReceiver has a strict 10-second execution window.
 * We use a [goAsync] + coroutine pattern to read DataStore without blocking the
 * main thread, then release the wake lock via [PendingResult.finish].
